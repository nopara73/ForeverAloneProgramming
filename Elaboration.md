# II. Elaboration Phase

![](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProgramming/blob/master/Resources/Elaboration2.jpg)  
The goal is to ensure that the team can actually develop a system that satisfies the requirements.

# Time requirements  
This phase usually takes 1-7 days to me.  

# Workflow

## 1. (Modelling) Brainstorming

**Try to see your project from a different perspective and keep collecting your ideas.** It is time to utilize our right brain again.  
There are advanced brainstorming techniques you might want to consider. If not, just do something unusual, make it fun, walk on the treadmill, smoke some marihuana, walk your dog, take a trip to Taiwan, whatever works for you, just keep some paper and pencil with you to collect your ideas about your project.  
For the smallest projects just do a quick minddump into a .txt.  

### Idea triggers

1. Your own brain: Write down anything that crosses your mind.
2. High level requirements
3. Lean canvas
4. ChatGPT
5. External resources (Google)

|Tip|

|Try to do some of the brainstorming away from the computer. When you sit at a computer it is tempting to open up a code editor and start to turn an idea into code. Before long you are deep in code and looking at one the one idea and broken the process of generating ideas. If you weren't writing code you might have had an even better idea if you had carried on thinking about it. For this reason it is often best to force yourself to leave your computer. Take a notebook out to a coffee shop, get some big pieces of A3 and some colored pens or a whiteboard and don't stop until you have ran out of ideas. |

It is a lot easier to rub an idea off a whiteboard because you have just had a better one than it is to throw away hours of coding work when you realise the path you are taking is not the best one.

When you finished you can archive the canvas, it would only be a distraction later.

## 2. (Modelling) Evolve the requirements  
You already have a high level understanding and consensus on what the system should and should not do. Bring your higher level requirements model to a lower level with the help of your previous brainstorming efforts.  

## 3. (Modelling) Construct the architechture  
Outline an architechture that satisfies the requirements. The requirements and the brainstorming will be your help here. Chances are you will want to make some modifications on your requirements after this. That is fine, but do not overdo it.

|Tip|
|---|
|To capture insight from your previous brainstorming efforts create a mindmap that helps you model your architechture. It should not be a formal document, like your architechture models, so whenever you finished creating your architechture, you can discard it.|

## 4. (Testing) Define tests in a high level!  

Your tests makes you confident the product you built is working correctly.  
The requirements and your brainstorming efforts will be enough hept to wrap up this part.

## 5. (ProjectManagement) Create a detailed schedule
Based on the detailed requirements, tests and your previous brainstorming efforts evolve your high level schedule into a detailed one and add some extra time for ~not~ expected complications.  

You can now archive your brainstorming efforts and your detailed requirements document, because they are now be included in this document.

## 6. (ProjectManagement) Adjust costs  
With the help of the detailed schedule and detailed requirements you are now able to better calculate costs.  

## 7. (ProjectManagement) Reach agreement on milestones
