# I. Inception Phase

![](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProgramming/blob/master/Resources/Inception2.jpg)  
The goal is to identify the initial scope of the project. 

# Time requirements
This phase usually takes 1 hour to 3 days to me depending on the communication overhead and the nature of the project.

# Workflow
Modelling, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Project Management: the AUP terminology calls them **disciplines**, so do I.  
This document only includes the most relevant disciplines under each and every **phase**, but you may find yourself need to work on the other ones, which is fine.  

## 1. (ProjectManagement) Gain general understanding over your project

First fill out a Lean Canvas. It forces you to think about the relevant questions you would otherwise skip. **Be superfical.** Feel free to leave some sections empty, do not get lost in details. Later it will be used as a reminder, not as a recipe. Also it will be soon discarded.

|**Do you have the freedom to choose what project you are going to work on?** If the answer is yes, take a step back and reconsider the one you currently have in mind. This is the perfect time to open that old folder where you have collected the milliondollar ideas you had during the years, but you have never actually bothered to review them. Look them up, quickly select 3 [to 7](http://phys.org/news/2009-11-brain-magic.html) with your right brain (instinctive decision making) and complete this first step for every one of your selected ideas. (Scratch lean canvases.) Finally choose the winner.|

## 2. (ProjectManagement) Setup project directory structure

I organize the directory structure of my projects by disciplines. In every discipline folder I have an `_Archived` folder for those items I do not actively need anymore, therefore they would only be distractions.  
Now grab your lean canvas and put it in the ProjectManagement folder.

Update: These days I just use GitHub and not following the disclipine folder structure too closely.

## 3. (Modelling) Define high level requirements  
What the system will and will not do? I usually just list these in a text file.

## 4. (ProjectManagement) Estimate cost and schedule

At this point it is fine to give a gut feeling estimation on how long every phase will take.  
You can get a more accurate estimation for the Construction (and Deployment) phase by giving a time estimation to every high level requirements you defined.  
Regarding the costs, try to identify the main ones. But remember the motto of this phase: do not get lost in details.

## 5. (ProjectManagement) Determine project feasibility

> (AUP) Your project must make sense from technical, operational, and business perspectives. In other words, you should be able to build it, once it's deployed you should be able to run it, and it should make economic sense to do these things.  If your project isn't feasible, it should be cancelled.

## 6. (ProjectManagement) Reach agreement on milestones

To exit any phase participants must agree the project completed the current phase's milestones.  
This should not be taken lightly. Do you find it catastrophic when your whole project changes nearing its end, because the customer "made a little modification"? Well, agreement on the milestones will not eliminate this risk, but certainly will lower the chance of it happening.  
Keep in mind, not only the stakeholders have to agree, the participants, too. You do not want to end up like this guy:
