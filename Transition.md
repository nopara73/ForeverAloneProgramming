The goal is to validate and deploy your system into your production environment.

# Time requirements  
How long do you think it will take? Double it and you have a better estimation.   

# Workflow

## 1. (Deployment) Finish documentation

You may noticed I did not forced you to create any documents without an instant purpose. This is not a coincidence. One reason is because creating documentation for the shake of documentation is a waste of time, but also different projects require different type of documents. User guides, installation, deployment, maintenance instructions, and so on. Chances are you have been already creating some of these. Dig the relevant ones up, organize and revise them.

## 2. (ProjectManagement <-> Implementation) Acquire stakeholder acceptance and/or revise your PMF fit

Other developer oriented methodologies tend to omit the marketing aspect of product development. It is mainly because the creators are used to developing internal systems. But what if you are the CEO, CTO and CMO of your company?  
You have to deal with the marketing by yourself. It also gives you the unique opportunity to achieve Product Market Fit (PMF).  
If that is the case and you are going to handle the marketing, create a marketing plan now and adjust the product accordingly.  
In case you are not your own boss and somebody hired you she/he will inevitably seek to make modifications. Gather all of your social engineering skills to gain her/his acceptance, but keep in mind the customer's ultimate goal with annoying you is to achieve product market fit.  

## 3. (Deployment <-> Implementation) Beta-testing

Sometimes you want to gain customer feedback before going all out. During beta testing a sampling of the intended audience tries the product out and you adjust the product, based on the insights, gained by feedbacks.  

At the end of beta testing do not forget to finalize the documentation and update your marketing plans.

## 6. (ProjectManagement) Reach agreement on milestones

## 7. (Deployment) Deploy the system into production

## 8. (Deployment) Start executing your marketing plan

## 9. (Deployment) Maintain the software  

Maintenance happens by the people who are responsible of operating the system and the people who are responsible of supporting the system.

Be sure to provide a way for users to provide you with feedback - either via your website or (if possible) directly from your app. Whilst you may be working on adding feature X to your software because you think the users will want it they may all be crying out for feature Y - and if there is no easy way for them to let you know you are missing out!
